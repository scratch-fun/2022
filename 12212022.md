# Homework for Dec. 21st 2022 (Winter Break)

**Finish before Jan. 2nd 2023**

Happy Holiday! Last week, we have learned how to create a jumping game! Wohoo! But I still want you to practice it by yourself.

## Instruction of the homework: (let the student doing the homework without watching the tutorial first, if they get stocked, they can then watch the video for that step)

Step 1: Log into your account on Scratch, and create a new jumping game, rename the game as your first name with "jumping game". For example, "jeff jumping game".

Step 2: Choose a character and make it jump whenever you press `space` key, or touch the character if you are using iPad.

Step 3: Create another character to let it glide repeatly, so that the first character can jump over it.

Step 4: Make the game stop when the character cannot jump over the second character.

Step 5: Record the score when you made a successful jump.

Advance: (Optionl)

- Make a background music while you playing the game
- Make a sound everytime your character jump.
- Reset your character so it will always start from the same location everytime we start a new game.
