Welcome to scratch programming class parents webpage!

## About Scratch
Scratch is the worldâ€™s largest coding community for children and a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital stories, games, and animations. Scratch is designed, developed, and moderated by the Scratch Foundation, a nonprofit organization.

Scratch promotes computational thinking and problem solving skills; creative teaching and learning; self-expression and collaboration; and equity in computing.

Scratch is always free and is available in more than 70 languages.

## Class Material
**If possible, please let your child bring a laptop, a Chromebook, or an iPad to the class.** *(a computer device with only MINIMUM requirements will works great, don't need any expensive one)*

Unfortunately, the school currently only has three Chromebooks. If your child cannot bring a computer device, we have to let them pair with others to share a school Chromebook and take turns performing programming. It is very important to let them have a hands-on experiment.
